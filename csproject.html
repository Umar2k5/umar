			<p>Python is a popular high-level programming language that is known for its simplicity, readability, and ease of use. It is a great choice for beginners because it has a simple and clean syntax, which means that you can focus on the concepts of programming rather than getting bogged down in complex code.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Python is an interpreted language, which means that you don't need to compile your code before running it. You can simply write your code and run it using a Python interpreter.
                </li>
                 
                <li>
                    Python uses whitespace indentation to delimit code blocks, unlike many other programming languages which use curly braces or other symbols. This makes Python code more readable and less cluttered.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Python is dynamically typed, which means that you don't need to declare variable types before using them. The interpreter infers the type of a variable based on the value it is assigned.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Python is a versatile language that can be used for a wide range of tasks, from web development to data analysis to scientific computing.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Python has a large and active community of developers, which means that there are many resources available to help you learn and solve problems.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Python has a simple and intuitive syntax, which makes it easy to read and write code. This makes it a great language for beginners who are just getting started with programming.
                </li>
            </ul>
